- `#include` is a preprocessor directive used to include the contents of header files into the current file. Preprocessor directives are instructions for the preprocessor, a part of the compilation process that occurs before the actual compilation of the code. These directives, which begin with a `#` symbol, modify or prepare the code in various ways _(will discuss ahead)_ before it is compiled by the compiler.
- `Header File` is a file with extension (.h or .hpp) contains declarations of functions, classes, attributes, and macros. You can think of the header file as a catalog of the book you are about to create. This catalog shows what to expect in the book. It is to be noted that header files can indeed contain the implementations but it is a good practice to keep the contents and the story (implementaion of the declarations) separate.
- `Implementation File` The implementation file (usually .c or .cpp) contains the actual definitions or the "meat" of what's declared in the header file. This is like the chapters of your book, providing the detailed content behind each item listed in the catalog (header file).
- `Object File` Upon compilation, these implementation files are translated into object files (.o or .obj). These object files are indeed in a machine-readable format. The key here is that they save time in the build process, the compiler does not need to recompile the implementation code once the object file is created, it will just use the object file to know the implementations of the declarations in the header files, which is quicker since no translation is done then. Now of-course when you will change the implementation code the object file will be updated.
- `Library File` When you create a library file, you're essentially packaging these object files into a single file (Book).
  - Static Library (.lib): A static library bundles the object files into a single archive that gets integrated into your executable at compile time.
  - Dynamic Library (.dll): A dynamic library remains separate from your executables and is used at runtime. This allows different programs to share the same library code without incorporating it into each program.
  - **Note:** Creating a library is especially useful for larger projects or when you want to reuse code across multiple applications. For a small, standalone project, creating a library might be unnecessary unless you plan to reuse components of that project elsewhere.
